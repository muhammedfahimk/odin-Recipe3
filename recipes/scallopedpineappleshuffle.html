    <h3><b>Description</b></h3>
    <p>This is a wonderful pineapple dish to be served with ham. It is a favorite at Easter in my family. The egg whites add a touch of lightness to it.</p>
    <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, whites and yolks separated</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>Â½ cup milk</li> 
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups cubed bread</li>        
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Steps </b></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg yolks, sugar, butter, and milk together in a large bowl. Stir in the pineapple and bread. Lightly fold egg whites into the pineapple mixture, then spread the mixture into a large baking dish.        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
